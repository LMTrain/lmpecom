            LM Books Search, uses Google API's for book searching. It searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned, converted to text using optical character recognition (OCR), and stored its digital database. Books are provaltTexted either by publishers and authors through the Google Books Partner Program, or by Google's library partners through the Library Project. Additionally, Google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives.

            The Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge. However, it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations, and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process.

            As of October 2015, the number of scanned book titles was over 25 million, but the scanning process has slowed down in American academic libraries.
